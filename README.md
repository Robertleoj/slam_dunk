SlamDunk is a lightweight 3D visualization library targeting SLAM applications.

The general idea is to provide an object tree where you can insert objects and transforms.

SlamDunk can then render these objects in a beautiful scene with intuitive controls.

We use ImGui to allow panel layouts for multiple scenes and visualizations.

For simple usage, you can allow SlamDunk to handle the render loop. In this scenario, you can create basic panel layouts for different visualizers.

For more advanced usage, you can create your own render loop, and instruct SlamDunk to render into ImGui windows.

SlamDunk is in very early development - demos, documentation, and usage examples are coming soon.
